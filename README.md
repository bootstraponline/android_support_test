In theory, [platform/frameworks/testing/](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/testing/+/master)
should match the Android SDK's com/android/support/test however
the projects that ship in the [Testing Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing-support-library/index.html)
such as [UIAutomator 2](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/uiautomator/package-summary.html) are not included in AOSP.
